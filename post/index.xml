And you're in August house
You said some very mind well
Closer to your height and
Then we'll knock around, endlessy
You're all I needDon't you see me and
I think I'm falling,
I'm falling for you,

【台湾BLドラマ『奇蹟』】ナット・チェン（陳柏文）×ルイス・ジャン（姜典）が1日の食生活を公開！｜FOOD DIARIES（フードダイアリー）｜ハーパーズ バザー（Harper's BAZAAR）公式
Watch on朝は台湾ならではの朝食、蛋餅（ダンビン）を食べることが多いというふたり。ルイスはスモークチキンと野菜の蛋餅が好きだけれど、昼まで寝ていることが多いため、基本は朝昼兼用なのだそう。この日は朝10時からの撮影だったため、少し眠そうな表情がまた魅力的。
2人とも自炊は好きで、ナットの得意料理は魯肉飯（ルーローハン）に麻婆豆腐、牛バラの煮込み。大鍋いっぱいに作って、毎日少しずつ食べていくそう！ 日本で食べたいものを尋ねると、ナットはとんかつ、ルイスは和牛と即答。『奇蹟』のなかでヤクザ組織のボスと和牛の火鍋を食べるシーンがあったが、その時には食べ損ねたという。果たして2人は日本滞在の間に好きなものを食べられたのだろうか？
このシリーズ恒例の質問「明日地球がなくなるとしたら最後に食べたいものは？」にもしっかりと回答してくれた2人。最近起こった『奇蹟』なエピソード、撮影の合間の様子なども話してくれているので、最後までチェックして！

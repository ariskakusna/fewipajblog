He took $20 from one son for getting a D on a math test and he gave another son an extra $35 for doing extra chores. Combined, the sons had $81. Figure out how much each son had. Let x, y, and z be the money each son received. To begin, x = y = z. But then, Dad took 20 from son X and gave it to son Y. So now, x = y - 20 Next, he gave Son Z an extra $35 for chores So z is now y + 35 since y and z used to be equal Combined, they all have 81. x + y + z = 181 But with the changes, it is: (y - 20) + y + (y + 35) Combine like terms: 3y - 20 + 35 = 81 3y + 15 = 81 Subtract 15 from each side: 3y = 66 Divide each side by 3 to isolate y y = 22 Since x = y - 20, x = 2 Since z = y + 35, we have z = 57 Checking our work, 2 + 22 + 57 = 81.<br></p><a href=# title="Click to jump to A financial analyst computed the ROI for all companies listed on the NYSE.

Determine the lowest possible sum of their squares. If sum of two numbers is 20, let one number be x. Then the other number would be 20 - x. The sum of their squares is: x^2+(20 - x)^2 Expand this and we get: x^2 + 400 - 40x + x^2 Combine like terms: 2x^2 - 40x + 400 Rewrite this: 2(x^2 - 20x + 100 - 100) + 400 2(x - 10)^2 - 200 + 400 2(x?10)^2 + 200 The sum of squares of two numbers is sum of two positive numbers, one of which is a constant of 200. The other number, 2(x - 10)^2, can change according to the value of x. The least value could be 0, when x=10 Therefore, the minimum value of sum of squares of two numbers is 0 + 200 = 200 when x = 10.

There’s a stigma surrounding infidelity that can be difficult to shake. It’s the same for the rest of us, right? And, true, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">being unfaithful to someone you love</a> is a terrible thing to do. But (and this is important) it doesn’t necessarily mean that the person who was unfaithful is a terrible person.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>In fact, there’s a lot to be said for someone who comes clean about their misgivings, takes responsibility and does what they can to work through their issues. While they clearly had issues with honesty in their past behavior, <a href=#>admitting they cheated</a> is actually a step in the right direction.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Granted, some celebrities are probably put up to confessing by their PR people. For others, though </span><span>—</span><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><span> Jay-Z springs to mind </span></a><span>—</span><span> fessing up feels like a sign of genuine remorse and change. So, in the spirit of giving these stars the benefit of the doubt, let’s take a look at some Hollywood A-listers who admitted to stepping out on their significant others.</span></p><p>A version of this story was originally published May 2020.</p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=5.1902730375427><h2>Oliver Hudson</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/celebrity-exes-who-never-buried-the-hatchet-2.png><p>Oliver Hudson admitted to cheating on wife Erinn Bartlett before their 2006 wedding in a 2024 episode of his podcast,&nbsp;Sibling Revelry.&nbsp;</p><p>“When I got engaged, something happened psychologically, and I spiraled, and I was unfaithful, and I was cheating, and I was crazy,” <a href=#>he admitted</a>. “I never got caught.
